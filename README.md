Project Title
Retail Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering Algorithm
 Objective
To segment retail customers into distinct groups based on their purchase behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm, enabling better marketing strategies and customer understanding.
 Problem Statement
Retail businesses often struggle to understand diverse customer purchasing patterns. By grouping customers with similar buying behavior, businesses can design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. This project aims to apply K-Means clustering to analyze customer purchase history and segment customers effectively.
 Methodology
Collected customer data from a publicly available Kaggle dataset
Selected relevant features such as annual income and spending score
Applied data preprocessing and feature scaling
Determined optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm
Visualized and analyzed the resulting customer segments
 Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
 Result
The K-Means algorithm successfully grouped customers into meaningful clusters based on their purchasing behavior. Each cluster represents a unique customer segment, helping businesses identify high-value, average, and low-spending customers.
 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how unsupervised machine learning techniques like K-Means clustering can be effectively used for customer segmentation in retail businesses. The results can assist organizations in making data-driven marketing and business decisions.
